# Exercise SBML databases

In this exercise we will model the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), which is the third step of glycolysis, catalyzed by the enzyme [phosphofructokinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis#Preparatory_phase). F6P is phosporylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) under the consumption of ATP.
